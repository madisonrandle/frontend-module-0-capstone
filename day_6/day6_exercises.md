## Functions & Scope

### 1. If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?



### 2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?



### 3. What is the keyword `return` used for?



### 4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
