## Images HTML

### 1. In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

The **alt** attribute (often referred to as _alt text_) provides a text description of the image. It should give an accurate description of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software and search engines. It's especially important for people with visual impairments.

### 2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?

When an `<img>` element is inside a block level element, you can determine that the image is _inline_ because any text or other inline elements will flow around the image. When an `<img>` element is _block_ the image is followed by a block level element. In other words there would not be text or inline element flowing around the image.

### 3. What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
