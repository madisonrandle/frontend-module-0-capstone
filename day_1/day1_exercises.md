## On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, is like the skeleton that gives a webpage structure.

## What is the difference between an **element** and a **tag**?

An element and a tag both refer to the markup used to write HTML. While they are often used interchangeably, there is a slight difference between the two. An **element** is an individual component of HTML and generally consists of an opening tag, content, and an end tag. **Tags** act like containers, used to mark up the start and end of an element. Tags usually come in pairs.

## Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. An attribute is a characteristic of a page element, such as font size or color. They are used to supplement a tag.

The attribute **name** indicates what kind of extra information you're supplying about the elements content. The **value** is the information or setting for the attribute.

## Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

HTML code reflects a hierarchy of HTML elements. The **head element** contains information about the page. The head element comes before the body element and will usually contain a title element.

The **body element** is used to store everything displayed inside the main browser window, or the text and images that you see when visiting a Web page.

_Empty elements_ do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They usually only have one tag.

## What is semantic markup?

_Semantic markup_ is an element that is not intended to affect the presentation of a web page. Semantic markup introduces meaning/information to a page. The reason for using these elements is that other programs, such as screen readers or search engines, can use this information. For example, the voice of a screen reader may add emphasis to the words inside the &lt;em&gt; element (the &lt;em&gt; element indicates where emphasis should be placed on selected words).
